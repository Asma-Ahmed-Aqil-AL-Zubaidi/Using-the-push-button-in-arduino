# Using-the-push-button-in-arduino
Using the push button with and without the Relay and the difference between them
The purpose of this report is to use pushbuttons
The explanation of the use of the push-button will be in two forms, with and without the relay

Question: Why do we use relay?
Why is a push button better than a switch?

Initially the key is used for two things, request and reverse, eg close the process or upload and download, and so if you use this button in the bot the bot will have to reach its arm so that it can shut itself down, and if it shuts itself off, it can turn itself on again and from Here comes the tap of the push button
It is a single button that can put more than one thing in it, like the button in smartphones.
Well, what is the use of a relay that provides the operating system for the push-button start and handles devices with high voltages up to 220V? Through the relay, a bulb or any electronic device can be connected to control it

Without using the Relay
